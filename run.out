Question: What are the most common model families?
SQL query: SELECT Model_Family.family_name, COUNT(Model_Family_Model.model_id) AS family_count
FROM Model_Family
JOIN Model_Family_Model ON Model_Family.family_id = Model_Family_Model.family_id
GROUP BY Model_Family.family_name
ORDER BY family_count DESC;
Query results: [('Supervised', 11), ('Nonparametric', 8), ('Parametric', 3), ('Tree-based', 2), ('Time Series', 2), ('Penalized ', 2), ('Generalized Linear Model', 2), ('Ensemble', 2), ('Deep learning', 2), ('Unsupervised', 1), ('Probabilistic', 1), ('Neural Network', 1), ('Lazy Learning', 1), ('Kernel method', 1), ('Geospatial', 1), ('Clustering', 1), ('Boosting', 1), ('Bayesian', 1)]
Natural language answer: The most common model families are Supervised, Nonparametric, and Parametric.
